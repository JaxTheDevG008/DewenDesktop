## Purpose
Most task and project management websites these days force a subscription on you, obligate you to use AI, and use your data to train models without your consent. 

To learn frontend, backend, full-stack, APIs, and client-side database management, I thought that it would be a good idea to build my own from scratch, completely stripped of these modern problems while delivering a clean interface, local-first privacy, and useful productivity tools.

## AI Usage
I used AI as a collaborative learning partner to help me with features, layout, and debugging, while still retaining the information the AI creates. Even though I used AI, this is not a fully "vibe-coded" or AI-generated app.
